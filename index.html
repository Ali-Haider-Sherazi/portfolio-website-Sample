          <h2>Assalam O Alikum</h2>
          <p>I graduated a month ago with a degree in Software Enginerring and have since worked as a front-end engineer. I have a lot of experience with HTML, along with CSS and JavaScript. I find these languages complement each other and help me keep the main newsfeed looking fresh and sharp. I also take professional development courses regularly, and I’m a consistent contributor to online code repositories.</p>

            <h3>Java</h3>
            <p class="java-desc">Java developers are responsible for creating program architecture for Java-based applications. They write, analyze, manage and test Java code. They collaborate with a team of developers and may need to work with clients to specify application requirement before programming a functional software system.</p>

            <h3>HTML & CSS</h3>
            <p class="html-desc">I have experience working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When I first began website design, HTML was my go-to. As I continued expanding this knowledge, I realized that adding both CSS and JavaScript to my repertoire would further enhance my skill set, giving me the ability to make websites more useful, interactive, and more functional overall.</p>
